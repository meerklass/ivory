Ivory workflow engine
=============================

Simple and flexible workflow engine

This **ivory** package has been developed at the `Centre for Radio Cosmology` at UWC and at the `Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics` at `UoM`.
It is based on the original `python 2.7` **ivy** package developed at ETH Zurich in the `Software Lab of the Cosmology Research Group <http://www.cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab.html>`_ of the `ETH Institute of Astronomy <http://www.astro.ethz.ch>`_.

The development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/meerklass/ivory>`_ and contributions are welcome. The documentation of **ivory** is not yet available at `readthedocs.org <http://ivory.readthedocs.io/>`_ .
